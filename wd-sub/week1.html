<!--
  Hey Laura, just a couple of pointers on your html here:

  First off, you'll want to review the link on your homepage. You named the folder "wd-sub" but you have "wdsub" without a dash in your link.
  Secondly, watch out for the little details when coding. Things like a space or a dash can make all the difference.
  For example, you have an extra slash in your closing h1 tag.
  Another example is how your comments are formatted. You have an extra > in your comment on line 18 which ends the comment before the paragraph starts.
  The result is that your second paragraph isn't commented out at all.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> week 1 sub</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- comment--> 
    <p>first paragraph  🩷</p>
    <!--> <p> second paragraph 🤍</p>-->
    <h1>week 1 sub<//h1>
    <h2> html</h2>
    <p> This tells the browser that the contents are in html.</p>
    <h2>head</h2>
    <p> This is a container for information not displayed on this page </p>
    <h3> Title</h3>
    <p> This always lives in the head. It's necessary for a valid HTML5 page.</p>
    <h2>body</h2>
    <p> This contains all content that will appear on the page</p>
      <br>
      <p><em>Click <a href="/gheen/index.html">here</a> to return home⭐</em></p>
  </body>
    </html>
